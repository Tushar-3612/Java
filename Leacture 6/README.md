# Java Functions Assignment

This repository contains Java programs created as part of my assignment on **Functions in Java**.  
Each program demonstrates the use of **methods (functions)** along with **user input handling**.

## Programs Included
- **Sum.java** â†’ Takes two numbers as input and returns their sum using a function.  
- **Division.java** â†’ Performs division of two numbers using a separate function.  
- **Factorial.java** â†’ Calculates the factorial of a number using a function.  
- **SumAndAverage.java** â†’ Accepts multiple numbers from the user and calculates both sum and average using functions.  
- **Function.java** â†’ Example file showing function declaration, definition, and usage .

## Key Concepts Covered
- Function declaration and calling in Java  
- Returning values from functions  
- Taking input from the user using `Scanner`  
- Basic problem-solving using methods
- It is very simple and helpful for handling and understanding .
